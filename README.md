A reusable library for managing LLM providers, authentication, and model selection.

This library is intended to be used by various Python-based AI projects to provide a consistent way to handle LLM interactions.

## Features (Planned)

- Manages authentication for various LLM providers (API Key, OAuth 2.0 Device Flow, etc.).
- Securely stores and retrieves credentials.
- Provides a factory for creating LangChain-compatible model instances.
